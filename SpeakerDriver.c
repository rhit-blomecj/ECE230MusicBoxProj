 * You need to #define SpeakerFreqTimer as one of the A timers so we can set it up properly
 * You need to #define SpeakerX with X being a number between 1-6 this is so we can set up the interrupt to generate its frequency
 * This driver cannot support more than 6 speakers at a time and all speakers will be controlled by the same Timer

//All Speakers initialized in this driver are required to have frequencies generated by the same clock
//This means that the limit of our number of speakers is the number of CCR units
//Clock should be set to Continuous Mode
//Relevant CCR Units (we can use #ifdefs to filter)
//  OutMod=Toggle
//  interupt enabled
//

//The ISRs will be in #if FreqTimer == Timer_A0 and we will just have a lot of those (probably only setup for TimerA timers and that will just need to be said in documentation)
//#ifdef SpeakerX blocks where X corresponds to the number of the CCR unit it should be controlled by should surround cases in switch/if statement
//when SpeakerX is defined it should be defined with a bitmask for a pin
